# Sorting and Search Algorithms

This C++ sorting program demonstrates mastery of basic concepts in C++. This application was created for my CMSC140 class at Montgomery College. It generates 200 random integers and stores them into an array. It then uses bubble sort to sort the array in O(n^2) and asks the user to enter a key value to find. If the value is valid, the program will search for it using both binary search and linear search, showing an obvious speed difference. This is my first complete program in C++ that includes everything I learned in the class. This project was done in full by myself.

## Programming concepts used
- Variables, Conditionals, Loops, Functions
- User driven programming
- Bubble Sort, Binary Search, and Linear Search
- File output
- Program planning and edge case testing

## Possible Improvements
- More data structures such as linked lists and hash maps can be used to speed up sorting and searching
- Measuring the time difference between algorithms can give more insight into how they work and possibly add the ability to visualize the big O of them.
